<h1>CAT-Audio-Box</h1>

Multi 'slot' audio recorder / player built on top of 'The Amazing Audio Engine' by Michael Tyson.

Created to replace the multiple AVAudioRecorders I had in one of my apps. CAT-Audio-Box records or plays one track at a time in the same style as a traditional tape recorder, but benefits from the additional features / expandability of CoreAudio.
