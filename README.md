<h1>CAT-Audio-Box</h1>
====================

Multi 'slot' audio recorder / player built on top of 'The Amazing Audio Engine' by Michael Tyson.

Created to replace the multiple AVAudioRecorders I had in one of my apps. CAT-Audio-Box records and plays singular tracks in the same style as a traditional tape recorder, but benefits from the additional features / expandability of CoreAudio. 

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>User specified number of recording 'slots'</li>
<li>Temp Recording to documents folder with finsihed set of audio files presented as NSDict of NSData</li>
<li>Auto recording stop and volume fade out</li>
<li>Compression / limiting / high pass filtering of audio via configurable Audio Units</li>
<li>Wav / Aiff / M4a / MP3 (osx) formats</li>
</ul>
